# Tropical Fruits Single-Page Webpage

This was an assignment for LaunchCode that I enjoyed. 

## HTML/CSS Elements
I created this using HTML/CSS to integrate the following into a single webpage:
* Paragraph, header, footer, main, and article divs
* Images
* Links
* Table
* Auido buttons
* Dropdown menu
* "Back to Top" link

I also got to experiment with using some HTML character entities, a little unicode (for the audio button icons), onhover to make buttons change color, and margins/padding in CSS.

The audio clips are my own original audio recordings. The images are not original to me.
